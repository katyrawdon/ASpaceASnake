# Backups README

This directory will store backup copies of resources you download. However it's very important that you move backups or commit backups or otherwise ensure that your backups really _are_ backups if you run the script again. If you download backups, update resources, and run the script again which downloads backups, they will overwrite the originals. Another way to deal with this would be to add something like timestamps to the backup's filename. This may be worth exploring but isn't done yet.
